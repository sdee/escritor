      <h3>Short Version</h3>
      <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        <b>I'm Sutee.</b> This project has been a labor of love for the last few
        years. I've researched the book over more than four years, enjoying over
        five hundred meals throughout Peru and countless conversations about
        food. I learned some Spanish so that I could interview dozens of people
        from fellow diners to chefs and cooks all over Peru. I took all of the
        photos you see and wrote all of the articles that you see, using my own
        research (typos and all). I also wrote the code for this blog (bugs and
        all).
      </p>
      <h3>Long Version</h3>
      <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        If you know anything, anything all, about Peruvian names, you’ll know
        that I’m not Peruvian. However, I ended up spending 10 months
        researching Peru (about 900 meals) and have been back three more times
        since.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        In a way, my discovery of Peruvian cuisine seems almost accidental. I
        drunkenly invited myself to Peru years before during an office happy
        hour while chatting with Carlos, a co-worker who grew up in Cusco. Two
        years later, I found myself along with Carlos and a couple of other
        friends on a whirlwind tour of Peru. The our first two weeks in Peru, we
        were tourists-visiting the Nazca Lines and Machu Picchu. Honestly, food
        was a bit of an afterthought in our packed two-week itinerary.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        Then I stayed behind to learn to cook from Carlos’s mom and step-sister,
        María. I had quit my job and didn’t know what I wanted to do. I just
        knew that I wasn’t going to be able to pay Bay Area rent while I figured
        it out. I wanted break from the abstract world of software and to do
        something with my hands. My roommate back in San Francisco who was a
        cook in a real restaurant kitchen dared me to cook in restaurant
        kitchen.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        With Carlos’s help, I was able to find an unpaid kitchen job. I didn’t
        know any Spanish at the time. While I enjoyed cooking, I was far from a
        professional as my roommate would often remind me. Suddenly, I found
        myself helping cook dishes that were exotic-to-me for people who grew up
        eating the food.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        The other cooks were lenient and forgiving when I would confuse two
        types of potato (to my defense-there are thousands of varieties in Peru)
        or forget a technique I had thought I mastered the day before. I never
        truly mastered the two-handed maneuver for peeling tomatoes that
        everyone in Peru seemed to know, whether they worked in a kitchen or
        not. When the kitchen wasn’t too busy, the cooks brought me new morsels
        of food packed with ingredients I’d never before seen to try. I quickly
        became enamored with Peruvian cuisine.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        After just two weeks of Spanish lessons under my belt, I eventually
        decided to travel around Peru specifically to learn more about the food.
        I couldn’t just eat all day so I started interviewing chefs with my
        meager Spanish. My Airbnb hosts, Tom and Paola were extremely supportive
        and helped me prep for each day’s interview.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
        Next thing I knew, I found myself traveling to the jungle, then to the
        largest food festival in Latin America, up the coast of Peru in search
        of the best ceviche, and finally back to Cusco. My friends joked that I
        was traveling in a never-ending circle. While I certainly certainly
        didn’t go the most efficient route, I felt like I was peeling away more
        and more layers each time.
