          This has been true labor of love, and your support will help enable me
          to find new ways to share stories and recommendations about Peruvian
          food. I hope that one day I will be able to create a print version of
          this book and find other creative ways to share my passion for
          all things related to Peruvian culture and cuisine.

          I'm constantly discovering new things about Peruvian food, and I'd
          like this book to reflect that. Major updates including new chapters
          will be made 1-2 times year. I will fix typos and outdated information
          on a rolling basis. The plan is that all updates will be free.
        </p>
