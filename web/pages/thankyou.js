          This has been true labor of love, and your support will help enable me
          to continue this project. I hope that one day I will be able to create
          a print version of this book. I am also looking to expand this project
          as I find new ways to share stories and recommendations about Peruvian
          food.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-10 text-2xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
          I'm constantly discovering new things about Peruvian food, and I'd
          like this book to reflect that. Major updates including new chapters
          will be made 1-2 times year. I will fix typos and outdated information
          on a rolling basis. The plan is that all updates will be free to
          everyone who bought a copy of the book.
